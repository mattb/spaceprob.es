OSIRIS-REx is a space probe on a mission to collect a piece of an asteroid and return it safely to Earth in 2023. OSIRIS-REx stands for the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer. In 2018, OSIRIS-REx will rendezvous with asteroid Bennu and will attempt to take a small piece of the surface using its sampling arm. Bennu is considered a primitive asteroid, having formed around 4.5 billion years ago. By studying Bennu, researchers hope to learn about the history of our solar system and how the natural resources present within the asteroid may be able to literally fuel future spacecrafts. Researchers also hope to learn more about how we could one day deflect asteroids since Bennu is considered a hazardous asteroid that may be headed for Earth in the late 22nd century.
