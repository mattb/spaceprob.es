Longjiang (龙江一号/二号), meaning "dragon river" and also known as DSLWP (Discovering the Sky at Longest Wavelengths Pathfinder) A1 and A2, are small twin space probes sent on a mission to observe solar radio bursts and conduct interferometry while they orbit the Moon. Unfortunately, Longjiang-1 failed to reach the Moon's orbit, but Longjiang-2 continues to orbit the Moon, snapping photos with its optical camera. LongJiang-1 has the ability to chat with amateur radio operators on Earth, who can ask the space probe to take and share images of the Moon with them. The space probe hopes to help future missions by faithfully testing out the technologies it carries on board.
